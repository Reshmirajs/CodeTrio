### Project Description
The Travel Alarm is a web application designed to enhance your travel experience by providing location-based reminders. It utilizes the Geolocation API to track your current location in real-time. You can set your desired destination and choose an alarm distance (in kilometers). As you approach your destination within the chosen distance, an alarm is triggered to notify you. A user-friendly interface allows you to easily enter your destination, select an alarm distance, and view your current distance from the destination. This feature helps reduce travel anxiety and ensures you never miss your stop.

### The Problem statement
Travelers often miss their intended stop, causing delays, wasted time, and extra costs. This happens when they unknowingly overshoot their destination.

### The Solution
The Travel Alarm app is your digital travel buddy! ‚úà It uses your phone's GPS to gently nudge you with a friendly alert when you're getting close to where you need to be. No more frantic searches or awkward backtracking ‚Äì just sit back, relax, and let Travel Alarm keep you on track.
